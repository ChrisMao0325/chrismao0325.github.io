## About Me

Driven by a fascination for how computational models can reveal and even engineer the rules of gene regulation in different cell types. I am currently an undergraduate research fellow at the Arc Institute, working at the interface of deep learning and regulatory genomics, advised by Dr. Jingtian Zhou. Previously, I have been fortunate to conduct research with Prof. Jian Yang and Prof. Jianyang Zeng @ Westlake University, and Prof. Ayshwarya Subramanian @ Cornell University.

## Research Interests

- **Regulatory Genomics:**   
  How DNA sequence and regulatory syntax encode cell-type–specific function.

- **Single-Cell and Spatial Multi-Omics:**  
  Modeling gene regulation in its biological and spatial context.

- **Machine Learning for Biology:**  
  Deep learning and generative modeling for sequence, chromatin, and cellular states.

- **Human Genetics & Disease:**  
  Linking regulatory variation to complex traits and disease mechanisms.

- **Synthetic Biology:**  
  Using predictive models to design regulatory elements and engineer cellular behavior.
